# PATHFINDING Visualizer

This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) built with React to visualize pathfinding algorithms in action.  It allows users to explore different algorithms and see how they navigate a grid to find the shortest path between two points.

**Visual Demonstration:**

* Check out a video demonstration of the Pathfinding Visualizer in action: [Link to your Loom video](https://www.loom.com/share/393d8ee15a244e8f8d2f5d92401dbb48?sid=4a0fab9a-ac7c-40ef-bb27-35deb97e3874)


**Supported Algorithms:**

* Dijkstra's Algorithm
* A* Algorithm
* Breadth First Search (BFS)
* Depth First Search (DFS)
* Backtracking N-Queen 
* Backtracking Bound And Branch Method Algorithm

**Features:**

* **Interactive Visualization:** Witness pathfinding algorithms step-by-step as they explore the grid.
* **Themed Nodes:** Easily identify the start and end points with clear visual differentiation.
* **Maze Creation:** Create custom mazes by strategically placing walls within the grid, challenging the algorithms to find alternative paths.
* **Customization:** Adjust the grid size (rows and columns) to suit your exploration needs.
* **Clear Function:** Reset the grid to a clean state for a fresh exploration.

**Technologies:**

* React Framework
* JavaScript

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/zaint10/react-pathvisulizer.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Open http://localhost:3000 (or your designated development server port) in your web browser.

**Usage:**

* Select the desired pathfinding algorithm from the available options.
* Click and drag on the grid to set the starting and ending nodes (typically indicated by different colors).
* Optionally, create a maze by clicking on grid squares to turn them into walls.
* Click "Visualize" to watch the chosen algorithm find the shortest path through the grid.

**This project provides a fun and interactive way to understand and visualize various pathfinding algorithms.**
